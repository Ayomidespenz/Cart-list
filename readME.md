This is a basic e-commerce Cart-list built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches product data from a `data.json` file and allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, adjust quantities, and simulate placing an order.

## Features

* **Add to Cart:** Allows users to add products to their virtual shopping cart.
* **Quantity Adjustment:** Users can increase or decrease the quantity of items in their cart directly from the product listing.
* **Cart Display:** Shows the items currently in the cart, including quantity and total price.
* **Remove from Cart:** Users can remove individual items from their cart.
* **Order Confirmation:** A two-step confirmation process before finalizing a simulated order.
* **Order Summary:** Displays a summary of the order before completion.
* **Start New Order:** Clears the cart and resets the product display to allow for a new shopping session.
